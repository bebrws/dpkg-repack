.SH NAME
dpkg-repack \- Utility to put an unpacked .deb file back together
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdpkg-repack\fP [\fB--root=dir\fP] [\fB--arch=architecture\fP] \fBpackagename\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dpkg-repack
creates a .deb file out of a debian package 
that has already been installed on your system. If any changes have 
been made to the package while it was unpacked (ie, files in /etc 
modified), the new package will inherit the changes.

This utility can make it easy to copy packages from one computer 
to another, or to recreate packages that are installed on your 
system, but no longer available elsewhere.

Note: 
.I dpkg-repack
will place the created package in the current directory.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.I --root=dir
Take package from filesystem rooted on <dir>. This is useful if, for
example, you have another computer nfs mounted on /mnt, then you can use
--root=/mnt to reassemble packages from that computer.

.TP
.I --arch=architecture
Make the package be for a different architecture.
.I dpkg-repack
cannot tell if an installed package is architecture all or is
specific to the system's architecture, so by default it uses 
.B dpkg --print-architecture
to determine the build architecture. If you know the package is architecture
all, you can use this option to force 
.I dpkg-repack
to use the right architecture.

.TP
.I packagename
The name of the package to attempt to repack.

.SH BUGS

Be warned that the author has only a shallow understanding of the 
dpkg packaging system, so there are probably tons of bugs in this
program.

This program accesses the dpkg database directly in places, querying 
for data that cannot be gotten via dpkg.
