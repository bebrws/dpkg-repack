Dpkg-repack tries to create a .deb file out of a debian package 
that has already been installed on your system. If any changes have 
been made to the package while it was unpacked (ie, files in /etc 
modified), the new package will inherit the changes.

When it works, this utility can make it easy to copy packages
from one computer to another, or to recreate packages that are
installed on your system, but no longer available elsewhere, or
to save the state of a package before you upgrade it or make some
other change that you fear may break the package.

There will certianly be cases where this program fails to work.
Please report them to the author of dpkg-repack, Joey Hess
<joeyh@master.debian.org>.

Be warned that the author has only a shallow understanding of the 
dpkg packaging system, so there are probably tons of bugs in this
program. Use at your own risk!
