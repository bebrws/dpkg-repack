dpkg-repack creates a .deb file out of a debian package that has already 
been installed on your system. If any changes have been made to the 
package while it was unpacked (ie, files in /etc modified), the new 
package will inherit the changes.

This utility can make it easy to copy packages from one computer to 
another, or to recreate packages that are installed on your system, 
but no longer available elsewhere, or to save the state of a package 
before you upgrade it or make some other change that you fear may break
the package.
